YASLC
=====

Source code for a compiler I made for DePauw's Compilers course. This compiler compiles from YASL (Yet Another Simple Language) to PAL (PAL Assembly Language).

## Usage:
Run 'make' to compile the compiler. The only dependency is g++.
Running the compiler prompts for a YASL source file, which has to be in the same directory as the program. The compiler outputs to 'out.pal'.
